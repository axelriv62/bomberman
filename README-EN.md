## Presentation

This project was realized out as part of a project of Directed Work (TD) in the third semester of the BUT in Computer Science at the IUT of Lens

The main objective was to familiarize ourselves with the identification and implementation of design patterns by developing a Bomberman game in JavaFX while managing the project using Git and GitLab.

<br>

## Objectives

In the context of this project, the different objectives were as follows:

+ Use Git in a collaborative work context.
+ Manage a project using GitLab.
+ Implement good object-oriented programming practices.
+ Identify and implement the decorator, proxy, strategy and state design patterns.

<br>

## Areas for Improvement

This project is still under development, here are the different features that remain to be implemented:

+ **Enemies movements**: Implement different styles of movements to make the game more complex (e.g. random, intelligent) with the Strategy pattern to manage these variants.
+ **Player and enemies life points**: Use the Decorator pattern to allow the player and enemies to have life points, making them more resistant to explosions.
+ **Temporary invulnerability of the player**: Use the State pattern to alternate between an invulnerable and vulnerable state, with a change of appearance to indicate invulnerability.
+ **Generation of different maps**: Implement different methods of map generation using the Strategy pattern to organize walls and other elements in a varied way.
